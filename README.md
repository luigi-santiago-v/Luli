# Luli Hydroponics

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a user-friendly, data-driven, and internet-connected hydroponics system. Targeting food deserts, it offers a solution for accessible nutritious food through a smart home appliance. The system integrates temperature/humidity, light intensity, and water pH sensors, along with UV lighting, a water reservoir, a pump, and a microcontroller into a single appliance. It provides real-time plant health and nutrient data, enhanced by a community-driven web application for sharing insights and tips.

## Key Features

- Comprehensive sensor suite for real-time monitoring
- UV lighting and water management for optimal plant growth
- Community web application for knowledge and tips exchange
  - Python Flask + MongoDB backend
- Designed with food deserts and local community reliance in mind
- **Budget:** $500
- **Duration:** 9 months

## Goals
Develop an open-source hydroponic system to enable community-driven, urban agriculture, addressing the challenge of food deserts and their impact on academic performance. The project focuses on simplifying the hydroponics process for beginners, providing a robust system for easy monitoring and maintenance, and fostering community engagement to sustain interest and success in hydroponic gardening.

## Milestones
- Research, design, and component sourcing
- System assembly and testing
- Creation of a functioning prototype from OSB featuring integrated control and monitoring systems
- Demonstration of prototype efficacy with basic crop growth

## Problem Addressed
Tackles the challenges faced by urban growers, including knowledge barriers and the need for continuous system maintenance. Aims to motivate and support users from construction through to the ongoing cultivation process, making hydroponic gardening accessible and engaging.
